Putting together a portfolio and I want to provide examples of modern web design techniques. 
As this may eventually become a portfolio have will be using Adobe XD to design some motion into:
Firstly a timeline animated with scroll down or keyboard arrow keys, leading into a projects section which will be animated from side to create interest and will include some kind of pop-out, animated carousel. 

The next section will be MERCH, primarily to use PRODIGI's API to connect to my own shopping page but sublimation and heat-press work is gruelling, especially in summer.(Their idea of becoming the global leader for customised merch is great. *that's enough creeping to try and get a job)

Want to incude some slick movemnent, great design, multi-layered

Roughed out basic semantic HTML outline including: 
header - Decided to keep position fixed to top (Why?)
navbar - three buttons with mouse-over, onclick. 
Title - using Google fonts API
Timeline Section - Just a small profile section that is presented in an interesting way to impress non-technical HR when applying for jobs and to distract from my apparent lack of experience. 
Parallax effects - am experimenting with photographs but may have to design my own assets in Photoshop. 
Portfolio Carousel - Must look pretty but most importantly have some projects of increasing substance as I progress. Highlight all you have learned as you go.
Merchendise Section - Using an API of a local company that is growing with hopes of impressing and getting a job :D
