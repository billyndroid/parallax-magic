# parallax-magic
Putting together a portfolio and I want to provide examples of modern web design techniques. 

As this may eventually become a portfolio have will be using Adobe XD to design some motion into:

Firstly a timeline animated with scroll down or keyboard arrow keys, leading into a projects section which will be animated from side to create interest and will include some kind of pop-out, animated carousel. 

The next section will be MERCH, primarily to use PRODIGI's API to connect to my own shopping page but sublimation and heat-press work is gruelling, especially in summer.(Their idea of becoming the global leader for customised merch is great. *that's enough creeping to try and get a job)

Want to incude some slick movemnent, great design, multi-layered

Roughed out basic semantic HTML outline including: 

header - Decided to keep position fixed to top (Why?)

navbar - three buttons with mouse-over, onclick. 

Title - using Google fonts API

Timeline Section - Just a small profile section that is presented in an interesting way to impress non-technical HR when applying for jobs and to distract from my apparent lack of experience. 

Parallax effects - am experimenting with photographs but may have to design my own assets in Photoshop. 

Found photo with adequate depth and potential to layer by ___ at Unsplash (credited in HTML code and footer)

imported into Photoshop 

selected outline of foreground (including human subject) using object select

added to selection using lasso object select

fine adjustments using zoom/ lasso tool

created layer from copy to be used as foreground image in parallax effect

expanded by 10px to remove any hard edges and prevent aliasing 

used content-aware fill to manually select area to sample 

prep to be used as background image for parallax effect by removing from background and cleaning up with clone stamp and various brushes using the eyedropper to select colours in vicinity

Portfolio Carousel - Must look pretty but most importantly have some projects of increasing substance as I progress. Highlight all you have learned as you go. 

Ideally portfolio will contain:

One static site with no slacking on design, movement etc

One dynamic site with some interesting usage of data, eg mixing financial data with weather data and presenting it to check if there are correlations. Could be interesting. 

One JS game using canvas - Have been building a simple frogger style game called Nutty Squirrel. 

JS project ????

Merchendise Section - Using an API of a local company that is growing with hopes of impressing and getting a job :D
